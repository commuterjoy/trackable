        <h1 itemprop="name">Bob Diamond cuts up rough as he quits Barclays</h1>
        <div id="article-body-blocks">
            <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bob-diamond" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Bob Diamond">Bob Diamond</a>, the boss of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Barclays">Barclays</a> who has resigned from the embattled bank, was expected to come out fighting for his reputation on Wednesday when he appears before a powerful committee of MPs.</p><p>The high-profile and outspoken banker is expected to unleash a wave of explosive revelations about the role of City watchdogs and senior Whitehall figures in the manipulation of crucial interest rates that landed the bank with a record £290m fine last week.</p><p>The chancellor, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne" title="More from guardian.co.uk on George Osborne">George Osborne</a>, who had been putting the banker under intense pressure to quit, said his sudden resignation was "the right decision for Barclays – and for the country". "I think Bob Diamond's resignation is the first step towards the new age of responsibility we need to see."</p>
            <div id="advert">cars, cars, cars</div>
            <p>After an extraordinary 24 hours during which the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, quit only to be temporarily reinstated once Diamond had departed, the role of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Bank of England">Bank of England</a> officials in the rate-rigging scandal is likely to take centre stage in the hearing with MPs.</p><p>With Barclays in turmoil, Diamond is fighting for his own reputation, which politicians have used to symbolise the culture of greed in City banking. Diamond, under pressure from the banking regulator and the governor of the Bank of England, Sir <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/mervyn-king" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Mervyn King">Mervyn King</a>, quit after he decided he would be the lightning rod for the scandal at the hearing.</p><p>The American-born banker, who could be in line for a payoff of £22m, is facing pressure to walk away with nothing after being paid £100m by the bank in the past six years. There are also calls by shareholders for the bank to look at ways of clawing back bonuses paid in the past.</p><p>In a statement, Diamond said: "I am deeply disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further from the truth."</p><p>At his appearance before the Treasury select committee of MPs – chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who the government has also appointed to lead a parliamentary inquiry into banking – Diamond will try to explain the bank's actions for the period between 2005 and 2009, when the attempts to manipulate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/libor" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Libor">Libor</a> took place.</p><p>Barclays released an email written by Diamond recording a conversation with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in October 2008, which will be scrutinised by the MPs.</p><p>The sequence of events unleashed by the email in the darkest days of the banking crisis also forced the departure of Jerry del Missier, who was Diamond's closest colleague at the bank.</p><p>Del Missier, a Canadian, was promoted to chief operating officer a fortnight ago, but was named as the top executive who instructed more junior staff to lower the bank's submissions to the key benchmark rate, the London interbank offered rate (Libor), at the centre of the current scandal.</p><p>MPs will be keen not to let the controversy over the potential involvement of the Bank of England – and unnamed Whitehall officials – to detract from regulatory evidence that prior to the 2008 crisis, Barclays traders were attempting to manipulate Libor to help boost the bank's profits. Emails that read, "This one's for you, big boy" and references to bottles of Bollinger champagne are hard for the bank to explain.</p><p>Diamond will admit that in the period from 2005 to 2007, when traders were trying to profit from Libor movements, the bank – along with others – believed it was a low-risk business and that it did not have systems in place to prevent the manipulation taking place.</p>
            <p>A submission by the bank to the Treasury select committee of MPs ahead of Diamond's appearance shows that the former chief executive will say there was no knowledge by anyone in the bank above desk supervisor level of this conduct at the time.</p><p id="midway">"Senior management were not aware," the Barclays submission says.</p><p>In the submission, the bank was quick to apologise. "These explanations are in no way intended to excuse any of  the events that occurred. These events should never have taken place, and Barclays deeply regrets that they did," the document said. The Libor rigging occurred over two phases: the first from 2005, when traders were changing rates at the request of rivals and colleagues, and the second during the banking crisis, when a conversation between Tucker and Diamond is becoming a key focus.</p><p>Diamond has made clear that he did not believe that Tucker had ordered him to lower the bank's submission to Libor – to help avoid any false impression that the bank was in difficulty – but Del Missier interpreted Diamond's remarks in a different way.</p><p>But the reference in the email to Whitehall sources asking Tucker why Barclays' submissions were higher than those of its rivals sparked speculation about potential involvement from government ministers.</p><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alistairdarling" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Alistair Darling">Alistair Darling</a>, the former Labour chancellor, said it was important that the Treasury select committee call Tucker "at the earliest possible opportunity" to ask for his account of the conversation with Diamond. He added that he had made no calls to the bank asking them to put pressure on anyone to lower Libor rates.</p><p>Asked if the Bank of England had ordered the banks to lower its rates, he said: "I would find it absolutely astonishing that the Bank would ever make such a suggestion, and equally I can think of no circumstances that anyone in departments for which I was responsible – the Treasury – would ever suggest wrongdoing like this.".</p><p>He added: "At the time these calls were made in 2008 it was just after Lehmans had collapsed, and just after the bank rescues, one of the things you looked at was how much it was costing banks to borrow because that gave you an assessment of their financial standing that is why it was so critically important."</p><p>He said the way to get the Libor rate down at the time was through policy such as credit guarantee scheme, and the special liquidity scheme.</p><p>A spokesman for another minister at the time, Lady Vadera, said: "She has no recollection of speaking to Paul Tucker or anyone else at the Bank of England about the price-setting of Libor."</p><p>Diamond is expected to tell MPs that when he was running the investment banking arm, Barclays Capital, the bank told the British Bankers' Authority, which ran the rate-setting process, that it was "consistently concerned" during the crisis about the lower rates being submitted by rivals. In the Lords, Lord Myners, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, contended that the BBA executive had been warned of Libor rate-rigging, but chose to do nothing about it.</p><p>Myners said: "What we need to do is to understand what went wrong here, which has cost this country so much – 7% of national output in perpetuity, millions of people placed in a position of distress, unemployment, worry about their mortgages – they're not going to be satisfied by an inquiry led by politicians."</p><p>The anger unleashed by the fine on Barclays – which is expected to be followed by regulatory actions – has led the government to attempt to set up a committee of Lords and MPs into banking. MPs will be asked to vote on Thursday whether to set up a parliamentary inquiry of peers and MPs into the banking crisis, as proposed by the government, or instead set up a judge-led inquiry, as proposed by Labour.</p><p>In the absence of any further private talks in advance of the vote, Labour will lose and will then have to decide whether to co-operate with the parliamentary inquiry or in effect block any inquiry by refusing to sit on the committee.</p><p id="end">Ministers are already preparing to accuse Labour of running to hide from its responsibilities for the banking crisis if it blocks an inquiry, and continues to insist only a Judge led inquiry will be effective.</p>
